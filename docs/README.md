# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This README provides a quick introduction to how we run projects at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new team member or just need a refresher, this guide will help you understand our key workflows, roles, communication practices, and quality standards.

## Our Approach

At OctoAcme, we follow a structured project lifecycle with five key phases: **Initiation** (defining the problem statement and stakeholders), **Planning** (scoping resources, milestones, and dependencies), **Execution** (building, testing, and iterating on features), **Release** (deploying and verifying in production), and **Retrospective** (capturing learnings and continuous improvement opportunities). Our approach is grounded in customer-first principles, iterative delivery of small increments, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning.

## Roles and Communication

Projects at OctoAcme involve several key personas working together: **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery, schedules, risk, and communications; **Product Managers (PdM)** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; **Developers** implement features and collaborate on design and testability; and **QA/Testing** teams validate quality and acceptance criteria. Our communication cadence includes daily or twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, weekly syncs between PM and PdM, monthly stakeholder updates, and clear escalation paths for urgent issues. We maintain transparency through shared artifacts like project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, and risk registers.

## Quality Assurance

Quality is embedded throughout our development process. We leverage continuous integration (CI) pipelines to catch issues early, employ multiple testing types (unit, integration, end-to-end, and smoke tests), conduct manual QA validation against acceptance criteria, use release checklists to ensure deployment readiness, and hold retrospectives to identify process improvements. This comprehensive approach ensures we deliver reliable, maintainable software that meets customer needs.
